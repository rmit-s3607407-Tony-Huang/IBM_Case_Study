## Company Information and Business Activities:

(International Business Machines) IBM is a multinational technology company which specializes in both software and hardware development, founded in 1911. The idea behind IBM was to bring together several companies to automate routine business tractions. The founder Charles Flint, built a number of trusts by merging several small companies to create a dominant player, this was done with International Time Recording (ITR), Tabulating Machine, and Computer Scale to create Computer-Tabulating-Recording Company, which was later renamed to IBM in 1924 when Thomas J. Watson was president. [1]

Thomas J. Watson was an American businessman and oversaw IBM's growth into an international force from 1914 to 1956. Watson developed IBM's business management style and corporate culture.[2] Fast Forward to 2015, IBM is one of the biggest IT ventures in the world and covers almost all IT related activities,  blockchain included. 

IBM, along with companies such as Digital Asset, Accenture, Fujitsu, SWIFT, VMWare was a founding member of the Hyperledger consortium, which was created in 2015. This project offers a development library to allow businesses to create customizable distributed ledgers solutions without using a public blockchain such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. In 2019, this consortium's membership exceed 250 companies across 14 developing projects.[3]

## Business Activities:

IBM was one of the first IT enterprises that saw the potential of the blockchain technology, and was one of the early R&D contributors which position IBM to be as one of the leaders in worldwide blockchain services. IBM blockchain solutions help a range of industries including supply chain management, insurance, IoT and quality control. [6]

IBM is actively collaborating with the Hyperledger project as IBM blockchain development actively uses the Hyperledger Fabric Network. It offers companies blockchain solutions by offering Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) which allow businesses to use cloud based solutions to build, host and use their own blockchain apps, smart contracts and functions on Hyperledger Network. [4]

IBM is one of the biggest IT ventures in the world, and covers almost everything IT related. IBM actively works as a consultant and host provider for other businesses, and IBM blockchain is just an extension into this field. 
One example of IBM offering their BaaS, is IBM Food Trust, a blockchain solution that makes food items traceable as they move through the supply chain. This gives increased transparency to what consumers eat and grow, eliminate food fraud, accurately judge shelf life, ensures the quality of food and minimizes food wastage. By 2019, this digital tracking system grew to over 80 brands, with customers such as Walmart, Albertsons, Dole, Nestle and Carrefour. 

IBM was placed nine in revenue amoung international IT companies in 2017. Due to its research contributions and development advancement level, IBM is often placed among top 3 companies. Seeing the balance sheet over the last 4 years, the spike in years 2019 could be attributed to IBM securing contracts with these 80 brands for just one of their blockchain solutions.[7]

## Blockchain as a Service Landscape


### IBM
---
IBM Blockchain services has introduced methods and best practices to bring blockchain ecosystem players together quickly and effectively for a business return producing networks of networks incorporating blockchain in conjunction with IoT, AI, automation and advanced analytics. By integrating blockchain and IoT is to seamlessly connect the physical world to the digital world and by perfecting AI and advanced analytics to enable users to see trends and anomalies and create better prediction models. [8]

This IoT/Blockchain integration enables solutions for:
1. Vaccine Distribution

With a vaccine distribution network powered by IBM Blockchain, manufacturers can proactively monitor for adverse events and improve recall management. Distributers can gain real-time visibility and enhanced ability to respond to supply chain disruptions. Dispensers can improve inventory management and safety monitoring. Citizens can trust the vaccines and confidently return to society.

2. Healthcare and Life Sciences

As the pandemic continues, healthcare and the life sciences face new challenges, including adapting supply chains to deliver protective equipment and rapidly developing treatments, tests and vaccines.

3. Supply Chain Transparency

With a supply chain transparency solution, you can create an immutable, distributed and shared ledger to transact with your supply chain partners in a more trusted and efficient way. In a world where speed, accuracy and connectivity define optimal supply chains, blockchain is essential.

4. Food Trust

Food Trust is the only network of its kind to connect participants across the food supply through a permissioned, permanent and shared record of food system data.

5. Trusted Supplier Management

A new blockchain-based solution for a faster way to qualify, onboard and manage suppliers



### Accenture
---
Accenture, another early researcher in the Hyperledger consortium is also among leaders in blockchain solutions services and contracting. Both IBM and Accenture are service based B2B companies that dominate the IT services arena.[9] 

Where Accenture differs from IBM, is it independence from any one platform with strong partnership with Hyperledger, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and Corda. A major part of their research was in digital identity innovations from biometric and blockchain based digital identity. 

Their strong ecosystem expertise allows them to seamlessly integrate existing enterprise software and cloud services to:

1. Financial Services Infrastructure

Blockchain empowers businesses to re-imagine how financial transactions are processed, from payments to post-trade processing.

2. Blockchain for Supply Chain

Streamline your supply chian by moving products to consumers with security and transparency

3. Blockchain for Digital Identity

Biometrics and blockchain-based proof of identity gives users more mobility, security and control.

4. Blockchain Security

Integrating existing infrastructure with any blockchain platform to generate and protect digital keys.

5. Real-time Gross Settlements

Platform for faster, more efficient, reliable and secure payments between banks and customers.
